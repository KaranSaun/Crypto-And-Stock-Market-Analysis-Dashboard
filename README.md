# 📊 Crypto & Stock Market Behaviour Dashboard  
### End-to-End Data Analysis Project using Python  

---

## 🔍 Project Overview
This project analyzes and compares cryptocurrency and stock market behavior using Python.  
The objective is to understand **price movements, volatility, trends, correlations, and risk patterns** through real-world data analysis and visual storytelling.

The project is built **from scratch**, starting with **dirty and imperfect data**, handling missing values, incorrect datatypes, and time-series challenges, and ending with a **dashboard-style analytical visualization** suitable for a professional portfolio.

## 🧠 Key Concepts & Skills Demonstrated

### ✅ Core Python
- Writing clean and modular logic  
- Functions, loops, and conditionals  
- Step-by-step reasoning behind financial calculations  

### ✅ NumPy
- Vectorized calculations  
- Statistical measures  
- Efficient numerical operations for time-series financial data  

### ✅ Pandas (Major Focus)
- Reading and inspecting large CSV datasets  
- Data cleaning (missing values, incorrect datatypes)  
- Datetime parsing and indexing  
- Feature engineering:
  - Daily returns  
  - Rolling averages  
  - Rolling volatility  
- Group-by operations for symbol-level analysis  

### ✅ Data Cleaning (Realistic, Not Perfect Data)
- Conversion of object → numeric datatypes  
- Handling null values in:
  - Prices  
  - Volume  
  - Returns  
- Forward-fill and statistical imputation  
- Time-series consistency checks
