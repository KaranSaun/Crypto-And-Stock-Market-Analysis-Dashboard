📊 Crypto & Stock Market Behaviour Dashboard
End-to-End Data Analysis Project using Python
🔍 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and comparing cryptocurrency and stock market behavior using Python.
The goal is to understand price movements, volatility, trends, correlations, and risk patterns through real-world data analysis techniques and visual storytelling.
The project is built from scratch, including handling dirty data, missing values, and time-series calculations, and ends with an analytical dashboard-style visualization.
🧠 Key Concepts & Skills Demonstrated
✅ Core Python
Writing clean, modular logic
Functions, loops, conditionals
Step-by-step reasoning behind calculations
✅ NumPy
Vectorized calculations
Statistical measures
Efficient numerical operations for financial data
✅ Pandas (Major Focus)
Reading and inspecting large CSV files
Data cleaning (missing values, incorrect datatypes)
Datetime parsing and indexing
Feature engineering:
Daily returns
Rolling averages
Rolling volatility
Group-by operations for symbol-level analysis
✅ Data Cleaning (Realistic, Not Perfect Data)
Conversion of object → numeric types
Handling null values in:
Prices
Volume
Returns
Forward-fill and statistical imputation
Time-series consistency checks
📈 Analysis Performed
🔹 Price Analysis
Closing price trends across assets
Comparison between stocks and cryptocurrencies
🔹 Returns Analysis
Daily percentage returns
Identification of high-risk/high-return assets
🔹 Volatility Analysis
Rolling volatility using sliding windows
